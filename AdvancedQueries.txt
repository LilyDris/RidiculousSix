SELECT First_Name, Last_Name, SUM(Length) FROM Patron, Checkouts, Media_Item WHERE Patron.Email_Address = Checkouts.Email_Address AND Checkouts.ID = Media_Item.ID AND Checkouts.Copy_Number = Media_Item.Copy_Number AND Media_Item.Movie_Flag = 1 GROUP BY Patron.Email_Address;

b. this doesn't actually work :(
SELECT First_Name, Last_Name, Email_Address
FROM Patron, Checkouts,
WHERE COUNT(Patron.Email_Address = Checkouts.Email_Address) AVG(COUNT(Patron.Email_Address = Checkouts.Email_Address))

c. 
SELECT Name, (SELECT COUNT(Media_Item.ID) FROM Checkouts, Media_Item WHERE Media_Item.ID = Checkouts.ID AND Media_Item.Album_Flag = 1 AND Media_Item.Copy_Number = Checkouts.Copy_Number AND Media_Item.Name = Name AND DATE('now') < Due_Date AND DATE('now') > Checkout_Date GROUP BY Media_Item.ID)
FROM Media_Item, Checkouts
WHERE Media_Item.ID = Checkouts.ID AND Media_Item.Movie_Flag = 1 AND Media_Item.Copy_Number = Checkouts.Copy_Number AND DATE('now') < Due_Date AND DATE('now') > Checkout_Date
ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID) FROM Checkouts) ASC;

d. 
SELECT Name, (SELECT COUNT(Media_Item.ID) FROM Checkouts, Media_Item WHERE Media_Item.ID = Checkouts.ID AND Media_Item.Album_Flag = 1 AND Media_Item.Copy_Number = Checkouts.Copy_Number AND Media_Item.Name = Name AND DATE('now') < Due_Date AND DATE('now') > Checkout_Date GROUP BY Media_Item.ID)
FROM Media_Item, Checkouts
WHERE Media_Item.ID = Checkouts.ID AND Media_Item.Album_Flag = 1 AND Media_Item.Copy_Number = Checkouts.Copy_Number AND DATE('now') < Due_Date AND DATE('now') > Checkout_Date

Y AS SELECT Email_Address FROM Chechouts WHERE CheckoutID = Z.ID
Z AS SELECT * FROM Artist Authors WHERE Artist_Authors.Name = f.Name (where ‘f’ is DB from question f)

h.
SELECT * FROM Artist WHERE Artist.Name = Y.Name
